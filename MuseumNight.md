### User Testing

**Question: What do you think about the waypoint navigation?**  
The crosses used as waypoints are somewhat 2D in nature, and difficult for the gaze to focus on, it would be better if the collider is 3D.  
*Action: Changed the collider component for waypoints from mesh to sphere collider.*

**Question: What do you think about the text popups?**  
It is annoying how the text disappears when the gaze is shifted away from the objects. They are also difficult to read from different angles.  
*Action:*

**Question: What do you think about the overall feel of the gallery?**  
The gallery looks good and spacious, however, it would be nice if there is a map on the wall indicating my location and labeling the location of each exhibit.
